## Overview
Where's Waldo? - RP Edition is a web game designed to emphasize the difficulty faced by individuals with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited eye disorders that affect the retina, causing a gradual loss of vision over time. This game aims to illustrate the gap in difficulty between RP patients and those with normal vision, as well as provide insight into how it feels to have a partial field of vision through its "tunnel vision mode."

## Gameplay
The objective of the game is, well, to find Waldo and click on it, it will then reappear on a new random location. Players with standard vision might find this task relatively easy, but for individuals with RP, who have a restricted field of vision, it becomes significantly more challenging.
For those who want to get a sense of how does it feel to play this with partial field of vision, turn on "Tunnel vision mode".

### How to Play
1. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Use your mouse to navigate within the limited field of vision and locate Waldo.
3. Click on Waldo when you find him to score points.
4. Continue until you are satisfied or click the "Stop" button to end the game.
**Toggle Tunnel Vision:** Enable or disable the tunnel vision effect which displays only a portion of the screen close to the cursor (desktop only).
